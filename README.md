# AuraPlexus
AuraPlexus is a magic mod inspired by Thaumcraft 6, but in the future it will have its own unique functionality. I hope...  
  
Mod is currently in the early stages of development.  
There is no much functionality from Thaumcraft, because I do not have enough programming skills to do it.  
If you have experience writing Fabric mods, please contact me.
